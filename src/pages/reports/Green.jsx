const intro = [
    "From May to August 2025, I worked as a VR/AI Developer Co-op at GreenContributor, which included a three-week global fellowship at the Moore Institute in Long Beach, California. During this term, I contributed to two exciting projects: developing an educational mobile app called FutureMindsChallenges and creating technology solutions to tackle plastic pollution. I learned new technologies, took on greater responsibility in planning and decision-making, and gained hands-on experience in sustainability-focused research challenges."

const greenContributor = [
    "GreenContributor Inc. is an organization dedicated to advancing environmental and educational initiatives. They provide global opportunities for students to engage in entrepreneurship and research-based programs, encouraging innovative solutions to real sustainability challenges that impact communities and inspire leadership in creating change.\n\nDuring my co-op term, I had the chance to experience these initiatives firsthand. I collaborated with Saddle River Day School to run the FutureMindsChallenge, a mathematical competition that encouraged students to think creatively about problem-solving. In addition, through GreenContributor’s strong partnership with the Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research, I contributed to projects focused on ocean conservation and developed technology solutions to support microplastic research and plastic pollution education."

const moore = [
    "The Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research is a non-profit organization and one of GreenContributor’s closest partners. They are dedicated to analyzing plastic pollution in oceans, beaches, and lakes, with a particular focus on analyzing microplastic particles using advanced methods such as FTIR image processing.\n\nFounded by Captain Charles Moore, the oceanographer who discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the institute’s mission is to expand public understanding of plastic pollution and its impact on marine life and human health."

const job = [
    "My responsibilities centred around two exciting projects. The first was the FutureMindsChallenge mobile app, which I developed in a team of two. In this project, I took on a leadership role, making key design and technical decisions to help guide the direction of the application. \n\nThe second was my fellowship project with the Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research, where I worked on creating technology solutions to improve microplastic measurement and streamline research processes in the lab."

const projectGreen = [
    "Designed RESTful API endpoints for quizzes, results, and user management",
    "Built a modular Express.js backend architecture with centralized routing",
    "Designed and implemented database schemas and wrote PostgreSQL queries",
    "Created Supabase functions to efficiently retrieve data",
    "Integrated RESTful APIs and JWT authentication for secure communication between the Flutter frontend and backend",
    "Designed intuitive, engaging user interface layouts and illustrations in Figma",
    "Supported beta testing with students worldwide, troubleshooting issues and improving the overall user experience"

const myRole = [
    "Manual microplastic analysis can be very time-consuming, especially when dealing with large sample sizes where each particle must be measured under a microscope one by one. To address this, we explored a program that automated part of the process. Using high-contrast checkerboard images, the system could detect plastic particles in each grid and then apply a secondary tool to measure their size and scale. The results were exportable to a CSV file for further research."

const projectMoore = [
    "Organized particle measurements into structured datasets",
    "Applied perspective transformation to correct image distortion",
    "Incorporated auto-cropping and scaling in Python",
    "Used OpenCV and PyImageJ to automate particle detection and measurement",
    "Implemented multiprocessing to significantly reduce manual processing time",
    "Presented our work and future research directions to stakeholders at the Moore Institute"

      "For our FutureMindsChallenge project, I took initiative to learn mobile app development through online resources, explored different technology options and design approaches. I participated in technical discussions where I shared insights and helped guide key tech stack decisions. These experiences strengthened my skills in planning, teamwork, and collaboration, while also giving me the confidence to make important technical choices in future roles. The project ultimately highlighted my ability to understand the reasoning behind each integration. It had a successful beta testing and mathematical competition with students."

const conclude = [
    "I’m incredibly grateful to GreenContributor for making so many opportunities possible for me. Through this experience, I gained hands-on exposure to innovative projects, worked with people from diverse backgrounds, and expanded my perspective by traveling to new places and challenging myself to grow. A special thank you to George Koshy, my supervisor, who constantly came up with ambitious and innovative ideas. He actively connected me with opportunities and gave me the resources to pursue them, which I’m truly grateful for. His effort to open doors for me made this co-op a truly unique experience.\n\n I’m also thankful to my two traveling partners across the States. To Jaeden, my coding partner, it was both of our first times developing for mobile, and working together through obstacles was a great learning experience that helped us both grow. To Manar, my traveling roommate, her inspiring story, dedication, and curiosity to make the world a better place taught me so much. She brought her uplifting spirit and passion to our work, leaving a lasting impact on everyone around her <3. \n\nFinally, I would like to thank the Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research for this rare and exciting opportunity. Having hands-on lab experience in California was truly memorable. Thank you to Win for helping with logistics, guiding us, and giving us the space to explore research projects on our own. And thanks to everyone at the institute who made us feel welcomed and answered all our questions. I’ll never forget the inspiring work I was part of at Moore, and being able to work right next to the harbour with the ocean just outside and the chance to walk along the water during breaks. It honestly felt like a dream"
